# Under The Radar (Restaurants)
* Under the Radar is a Philadelphia-based website that allows users to track restaurants that are not on popular "Best Of" lists. Users can add little-known restaurants to popular dining destinations (neighborhoods) and an ongoing list of what they ordered, what they loved, and what they might skip out on next time.
